#Hekaerge
A module to sort locations by *tomacco*

- the `Hekaerge` Class allows you to mantain a list of geo locations (`HekaergeLocation`) objects sorted by distance to your current location. 
Current location is fetched **only** via bluetooth beacons, specifically, by the beacons supported by [MOCA Platform](http://mocaplatform.com) Mobile SDKs

###Initializing a Hekaerge object

`- (instancetype)initWithLocations: (NSArray<HekaergeLocation *> *) locations`

####Parameters

- ***locations***: An array of `HekaergeLocation` that will be tracked as users moves around.
 
###Getting the sorted array

- There are two methods to get a sorted array of locations:
	-  One is **synchronous** method. The first time you instantiate `Hekaerge`, you can try to get a sorted array by calling `getOrderedLocations` just after `Hekaerge` is instantiated for the first time. It will check if there are beacons in range, if there are it will return a sorted array based on the current position. If bluetooth is off, or no beacons are in range, the locations will be get in the same order you provided them to `Hekaerge`
	- Async method; callback via delegation. When the device enters in range of a beacon, MOCA SDK reports it to `Hekaerge` and it, in turn, will return the sorted array to your delegate. Just remember to have a strong reference to your `Hekaerge` instance.

- `Hekaerge` takes account of the radius of the location to measure the distance. As buildings are not circles, you can increase the confidence by creating multiple `HekaergeLocation`s for a building.

- Example:

	- <img src="buildings.png" width=600/>

####Sorting policies

(relevant for buildings with multiple floors)  
- If two Geofences overlap, and you are inside of both, the **floor** will be used to select the right one.  
- If two Geofences overlap, **with the same floor**, and you are inside both, the smaller one will be sorted first.


####Current limitations
- Alttitude is not used to calculate distance (only a 2D plane).
- Proximity changes in the beacons in range are not used to recalculate distances. (Better performance).

###HekaergeLocation

A `HekaergeLocation` object represents a location. This object incorporates:  
- Identifier: String with name of location
- 2D Coordinate (latitude, longitude)  
- Radius: similar to a GeoFence.  
- Floor: floor level for overlapping geofences.
